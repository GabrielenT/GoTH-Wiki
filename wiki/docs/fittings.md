# Guardians of the Horde Incursion Fittings

In general, our fittings require the following minimum requirements (all before boosts):

* 70% omni shield resistances
* 100k EHP for battleships and above

Most fittings are loose as long as you meet these requirements, with the exception of T3Cs unless otherwise noted

## Travel refit

All ships (both subcap and capital) should include some form of a travel fit. This usually includes the following:

* Mobile Depot
* Cloak
* 4 Warp Core Stabilizers
* Travel MWD (50k for battleships, 500k for capitals)
* MJD for battleships

These modules allow you to move (mostly) safely through an incursion constellation as well as reasonably safely in space.

## Fitting questions

If you are ever unsure of your fit, please ask any of the FCs in Discord. They will help you when possible or direct you to other suitable options
