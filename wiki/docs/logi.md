# Guardians of the Horde Incursion Fittings

## Logistics

Whenever possible, we prefer [T3C](T3Cs.md) logi over normal cruiser logi. They have ~2.5x the EHP and are safer to travel with. However, Scimitars are still accepted ships.
In general, you can take your doctrine Scimitar and refit the MWD to an Afterburner.

However, if you wish to have a specialised incursion Scimitar, below is an acceptable fit.
